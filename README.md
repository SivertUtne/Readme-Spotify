This was little project i came across when i realised i could have a readme for mye profile. The original is created by [Andrew Novac](https://github.com/novatorem), but i found that the original didn't quite match the way i wanted it, so i customized it a fair bit. The original is as seen below and can be found [here](https://github.com/novatorem/novatorem) with instructions on how to set it up yourself:
